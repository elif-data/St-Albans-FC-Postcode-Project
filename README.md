Introduction:


St Albans City FC have seen growing matchday attendances in recent years, rising from an
average of ~900 to ~1600 attendees per game, one of the highest average attendances in
the National League South. 

This increase in attendance is down to hard work off the pitch
from an increased social media presence as well as outreach programmes to local schools,
bolstering “next-gen” supporters.


Another factor towards the
increase in matchday attendees
has been down to the analysis of the
data collected by the club. Analysis of
this data has been used to adjust
media drives based on predicted
attendances and to highlight
target age groups. 

However, the
club’s dataset contains a higher
level of detail and more analysis I
needed to help the club increase
attendances further and prepare
for the future.

Aims:


In this data analysis project, we want you to analyse the ticket sales data from the
2023/2024 season was finalised recently. This project aims to address a few questions:


- Where are supporters based? This may include season tickets and general sale
tickets.


- How do the supporter demographics look in terms of postcodes?


- Where should the club target with outreach programmes to increase the support
base?


- If the club were to relocate, what are the best options for the new ground?


An important area of data analysis related to this project is the locational distribution of
season tickets and ticket sales in the surrounding St Albans area. Analysis of the postcode data
of customers will help the club understand where supporters are based and how they may travel to games. 

More information regarding this is key for the club’s
growth, especially for a potential ground relocation
