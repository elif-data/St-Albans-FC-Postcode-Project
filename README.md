Introduction:
St Albans City FC have seen growing matchday attendances in recent years, rising from an
average of ~900 to ~1600 attendees per game, one of the highest average attendances in
the National League South. This increase in attendances is down to hard work off the pitch
from an increased social media presence as well as outreach programmes to local schools,
bolstering “next-gen” supporters.
Another factor towards the
increase in matchday attendees
has been down to analysis of the
huge amount of data now
collected by the club. Analysis of
this data has been used to adjust
media drives based on predicted
attendances and to highlight
target age groups. However, the
club’s dataset contains a higher
level of detail and more analysis I
needed to help the club increase
attendances further and prepare
for the future.
Aims:
In this data analysis project, we want you to analyse the ticket sales data from the
2023/2024 season finalised recently. This project aims to address a few questions:
- Where are supporters based? This may include season tickets and general sale
tickets.
- How does the supporter demographics look in terms of postcodes?
- Where should the club target with outreach programmes to increase the support
base?
- If the club were to relocate, how difficult would it be for supporters to get to the
new ground? And how could this be fixed.
- And any other analysis which provides useful information for the club.
An important area of data analysis related to this project is the locational distribution of
season tickets and ticket sales in the surrounding St Albans area. Analysis of postcode data
of customers will help the club gain an understanding of where supporters are based as well
as how they may travel to games. More information regarding this is key for the club’s
growth, especially for a potential ground relocation
